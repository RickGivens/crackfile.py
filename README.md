# crackfile.py
This program will read the contents of two files into separate dictionaries, search for identical keys in both dictionaries, and return the corresponding values. The original intent of this program is to compare a list of usernames and hashed passwords to a rainbow table. The program will search the rainbow table for the hashed password, and return both the username and password.
